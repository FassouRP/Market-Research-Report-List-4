<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber-optic Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multi-Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Fiber-optic cable market is divided into two main types: Single-Mode and Multi-Mode. Single-Mode cables have a smaller core size, allowing for only one mode of light to travel through the fiber. They are best suited for long-distance communication due to their low signal attenuation. On the other hand, Multi-Mode cables have a larger core size, allowing for multiple modes of light to travel through the fiber. They are ideal for short-distance communication, such as within buildings or data centers.</p></p>
