<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wastewater Evaporators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Floating Evaporators</li><li>Trajectory Evaporators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wastewater evaporators are devices used to treat and dispose of wastewater by evaporating the liquid content. Floating evaporators are designed to float on the surface of wastewater ponds or lagoons, where they evaporate the water using heat sources such as solar energy. Trajectory evaporators, on the other hand, use a rotating sprinkler system to disperse wastewater into the air, allowing it to evaporate before settling back into the pond. Both types of evaporators are commonly used in industrial and municipal wastewater treatment processes.</p></p>
