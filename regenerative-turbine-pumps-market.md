<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Regenerative Turbine Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Stage Regenerative Turbine Pumps</li><li>Multi-Stage Regenerative Turbine Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Regenerative turbine pumps are classified into two main types: Single-stage regenerative turbine pumps and multi-stage regenerative turbine pumps. Single-stage pumps have a single impeller that generates fluid flow, while multi-stage pumps consist of multiple impellers that work together to increase pressure and flow rate. Single-stage pumps are typically used for low-pressure applications, while multi-stage pumps are ideal for high-pressure situations. Both types of pumps are designed for generating hydraulic energy through the rotation of impellers within the pump.</p></p>
