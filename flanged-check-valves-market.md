<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flanged Check Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flanged Swing Check Valves</li><li>Flanged Ball Check Valves</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flanged Swing Check Valves are types of valves with a hinged disc that swings open to allow flow in one direction and automatically closes to prevent backflow. Flanged Ball Check Valves, on the other hand, use a ball to control the flow of fluid, allowing it to pass through when the pressure is higher on the inlet side. Both types of valves are commonly used in industrial applications to prevent the reversal of flow and ensure system efficiency and safety.</p></p>
