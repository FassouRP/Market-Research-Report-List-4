<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Three-Phase Current Relays Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Under-Current Detection</li><li>Over-Current Detection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Under-current detection and over-current detection are two types of three-phase current relays used in industrial applications. Under-current detection relays are designed to monitor the current flowing through a system and trigger an alarm or shut off the power if the current drops below a certain threshold, indicating a fault or failure. On the other hand, over-current detection relays are used to protect equipment from damage caused by excessive current flow by detecting when the current exceeds a specified limit and cutting off power to prevent further damage.</p></p>
