<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Centrifugal Subsea Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Stage Pumps</li><li>Multi-Stage Pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Centrifugal subsea pumps are classified into two main types: single-stage pumps and multi-stage pumps. Single-stage pumps are designed to handle low to moderate flow rates and are ideal for applications where there is a consistent pressure requirement. On the other hand, multi-stage pumps are suited for high-pressure applications as they can deliver increased pressure with each additional stage. Both types of pumps are commonly used in subsea oil and gas production to transport fluids from the seabed to the surface.</p></p>
