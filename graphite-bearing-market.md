<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Graphite Bearing Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Bearing</li><li>Axial Bearing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Graphite bearings are commonly divided into two types based on their application: radial bearings and axial bearings. Radial bearings are designed to support loads perpendicular to the rotating shaft, providing smooth rotation and reduced friction. On the other hand, axial bearings are used to support loads parallel to the rotating shaft, allowing for thrust control and precise axial movements. Both types of graphite bearings play crucial roles in various industrial applications, ensuring reliable performance and durability.</p></p>
