<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cathodic Protection Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Galvanic</li><li>Impressed Current</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cathodic Protection Systems are divided into two main types: Galvanic and Impressed Current. Galvanic systems use sacrificial anodes that corrode over time to protect the metal structure, while Impressed Current systems use an external power source to create an electric current that protects the metal from corrosion. Galvanic systems are simpler and more cost-effective, making them popular for smaller applications, while Impressed Current systems are often used in larger, more complex structures that require a higher level of corrosion protection.</p></p>
