<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquified Natural Gas Carrier Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self-supporting Type</li><li>Film Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) carriers can be categorized into two primary types: self-supporting and film type. Self-supporting type LNG carriers are designed with a spherical containment system, which allows them to carry LNG at very low temperatures. On the other hand, film type carriers utilize a prismatic-shaped containment system, making them more cost-effective and easier to manufacture. Both types have their own advantages and are used based on various factors such as cost, efficiency, and safety requirements in the LNG transportation industry.</p></p>
