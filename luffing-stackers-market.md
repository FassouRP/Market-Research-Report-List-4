<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Luffing Stackers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Slewing</li><li>Non Slewing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Luffing stackers are commonly divided into two market types based on their operating mechanism: slewing and non-slewing. Slewing luffing stackers have the ability to rotate their upper structure horizontally, allowing for greater flexibility in stacking and reaching materials. Non-slewing luffing stackers, on the other hand, have a fixed upper structure and rely on their luffing mechanism to adjust the height of the boom. Both types of stackers serve different purposes and cater to different industries based on their specific requirements.</p></p>
