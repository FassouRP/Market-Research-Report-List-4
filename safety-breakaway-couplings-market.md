<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Breakaway Couplings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Separation Via Breaking Pins</li><li>Separation Via Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Safety breakaway couplings are designed to prevent damage or spills in industrial settings by separating when excessive force is applied. Two common types are separation via breaking pins and separation via cables. Separation via breaking pins involves the coupling separating when a certain force is applied, breaking the pins holding it together. Separation via cables involves the coupling separating when a cable connecting the two parts is pulled, triggering the release mechanism. Both types provide a quick and effective way to prevent accidents and ensure safety in various industries.</p></p>
