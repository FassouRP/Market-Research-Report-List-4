<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Battery Isolator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Diode Type</li><li>Relay Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>A battery isolator is a device used in vehicles to separate the main battery from auxiliary batteries to prevent power drainage. There are two main types of battery isolators: diode type and relay type. Diode type isolators use diodes to separate the batteries, while relay type isolators use electromechanical relays. Diode type isolators are simpler and cheaper, but can cause voltage drop. Relay type isolators are more reliable and efficient, but are more expensive and complex to install. Both types have their own advantages and disadvantages in the market.</p></p>
