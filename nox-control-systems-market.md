<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NOx Control Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) Reaction</li><li>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Reaction</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction (SNCR) Reaction is a type of NOx control system that reduces nitrogen oxide emissions through the injection of a reagent such as ammonia or urea into combustion flue gas. This method does not require a catalyst for the reaction to occur. On the other hand, Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) Reaction involves the use of a catalyst to convert nitrogen oxides into nitrogen and water through a chemical reaction. SCR systems are known for their higher efficiency in reducing NOx emissions compared to SNCR systems.</p></p>
