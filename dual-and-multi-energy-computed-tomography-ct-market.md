<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dual and Multi Energy Computed Tomography CT Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Dual-source</li><li>Rapid kVp Switching</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dual-energy computed tomography (CT) involves the use of two energy sources, typically with a dual-source or rapid kVp switching system. Dual-source CT utilizes two X-ray tubes and detectors at different energy levels to simultaneously acquire images, providing enhanced contrast and tissue differentiation. Rapid kVp switching CT rapidly switches between two energy levels during a single scan, offering similar benefits in a single-source system. These advanced technologies have revolutionized medical imaging by enabling improved diagnostic accuracy and enhanced visualization of soft tissues and pathologies.</p></p>
